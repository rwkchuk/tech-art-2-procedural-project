# tech-art-2-procedural-project
Some unfinished UE4 code for a procedural project 

The project was an assignment but the requirments were all self made. I really liked the galak z gdc talk so I wanted to take a
  shot at doing the same type of procedural setup in UE4. At the end of the day I compeleted my project requirments but there is
  some duck tape holding this code together some of which is very dirty.
